Description
===========

ControlMyMonitor allows you view and modify the settings of your monitor
(Also known as 'VCP Features'), like brightness, contrast, sharpness,
red/green/blue color balance, OSD Language, Input Port (VGA , DVI , HDMI
) and more... You can modify the monitor settings from the GUI and from
command-line. You can also export all settings of your monitor into a
configuration file and then later load the same configuration back into
your monitor.



System Requirements
===================


* Any version of Windows, starting from Windows Vista and up to Windows
  11.
* Hardware that supports DDC/CI.



Versions History
================


* Version 1.43:
  o Added 'Black Background' option (Under the View menu). When it's
    turned on, the main table is displayed in black background and white
    text, instead of default system colors.

* Version 1.42:
  o Added /Wait command-line option to wait the specified number of
    milliseconds before executing the next command.

* Version 1.41:
  o Added 'Input Select - Use Only One Byte' option (Under the
    Options menu). In previous versions it was only available to change
    from the .cfg file (UseOnlyOneByte value)
  o When it's turned on, ControlMyMonitor uses only the first byte of
    the 'Input Select' value. If you have issues with the 'Input Select'
    feature, you can try to turn off/on this option.

* Version 1.40:
  o Added 'Loading Mode' option. You can choose 3 different modes:
    Load only VCP codes from list provided by the monitor (The default
    option), Try to load all VCP codes, Load only the specified VCP codes.
  o Added 'Try to read VCP code again if it fails in the first time'
    option. If some of the VCP codes are randomly missing when you
    refresh, you should try to turn on this option.
  o The new options are available in the 'Advanced Options' window
    (Options -> Advanced Options or simply press F9).
  o Fixed ControlMyMonitor to display the 'Possible Values' column if
    the monitor provides this information (This feature was accidentally
    disabled in one of the ControlMyMonitor updates).

* Version 1.38:
  o Fixed bug: On some monitors, ControlMyMonitor detected the
    available VCP features incorrectly.

* Version 1.37:
  o Added 'Short Monitor ID' string for using to identify the monitor
    from command-line. You can get the 'Short Monitor ID' of your monitor
    by using the 'Copy Monitor Strings' option (Ctrl+M).
  o Updated to use only the first byte of 'Input Select' (VCP Code
    60), as a workaround for some monitors that provide incorrect 'Input
    Select' value. If from some reason you want to disable this option,
    simply open ControlMyMonitor.cfg with any text editor, and set the
    UseOnlyOneByte value to 0

* Version 1.36:
  o Added 'Start As Hidden' option. When this option and 'Put Icon On
    Tray' option are turned on, the main window of ControlMyMonitor will
    be invisible on start.

* Version 1.35:
  o Added 4 display filter options: Display Read+Write, Display Read
    Only, Display Write Only, Display Manufacturer Specific.

* Version 1.31:
  o you can now use 'Secondary' as the monitor string in all
    command-line options in order to specify the secondary monitor.

* Version 1.30:
  o When there is a DDC/CI error (Error codes like 0xC0262582,
    0xC0262583), the error description is now displayed in the status bar
    in addition to the error code.
  o You can also click the error code with the mouse in order to copy
    the error code and error description to the clipboard.

* Version 1.29:
  o Added option to choose another font (name and size) to display in
    the main window.

* Version 1.28:
  o Fixed some display issues in high DPI mode (Toolbar and status

    monitor.
  o Added /SwitchOffOn command-line option to switch the specified
    monitor between on and off state.

* Version 1.26:
  o When ControlMyMonitor fails to get the current monitor settings,
    error code is now displayed in the status bar.

* Version 1.25:
  o Added 'Put Icon On Tray' option.

* Version 1.20:
  o Added /SwitchValue command-line option, which allows you to
    switch between multiple values.
  o For example, in order to switch the monitor off when it's turned
    on and switch it on when it's turned off, use the following command:
    (On some monitors you should use 4 instead of 5)
    ControlMyMonitor.exe /SwitchValue "\\.\DISPLAY1\Monitor0" D6 1 5

* Version 1.17:
  o When pressing F5 (Refresh) the refresh process is smoother,
    keeping the last selected item.
  o Added 'Load Selected Monitor On Start' option.

* Version 1.16:

  o Added 'Refresh Monitors List' option (Ctrl+F5).

* Version 1.00 - First release.



Start Using ControlMyMonitor
============================

ControlMyMonitor doesn't require any installation process or additional
DLL files. In order to start using it simply run the executable file -
ControlMyMonitor.exe

After running ControlMyMonitor, the current settings of your monitor are
displayed in the main window. If you have multiple monitors, you can
choose another monitor from the monitor combo-box below the toolbar.
In order to modify a single item, select the item that you want to
change, and then double click the item (or press the F6 key). You can
also increase or decrease the current value by using the 'Increase Value'
or 'Decrease Value' options (Under the Action menu). You can also
increase/decrease values by using the mouse wheel, according to the
selected option in Options -> Change Value With Mouse Wheel. By default,
the mouse wheel feature is active when you hold down the Ctrl key.



Restore Factory Defaults
========================

There are some write-only items that allow you to restore the factory
defaults of the monitor. In order to activate these items, you have to
set the value to 1.



Save/Load Config
================

ControlMyMonitor allows you to export all read/write properties into a
simple text file and then later load these properties back to the
monitor. You can find the save/load config feature under the File menu
('Save Monitor Config' and 'Load Monitor Config').



Error 0xc0262582, 0xc0262583 and similar codes
==============================================

If you get error 0xc0262582 (or similar codes) and the main window of
ControlMyMonitor is empty, it means that Windows operating system cannot
connect your monitor using DDC/CI.
Here's what you can do in order to try to solve the problem:
* Update the driver of your graphics card.
* Try to plug your monitor using different type of cable/connector
  (VGA, DVI, HDMI, DisplayPort).
* If you use a KVM switch, try to plug your monitor directly to the
  computer, without the KVM switch.




Before you report a bug...
==========================

Be aware that if you have a specific setting that ControlMyMonitor fails
to set properly or ControlMyMonitor fails to connect your monitor
completely with error code (usually begins with 0xc02625 ), It's not a
bug or problem in ControlMyMonitor tool, but in your hardware.
It might be a bug with the chip of your monitor or with the driver of
your graphics card or a problem with the cable/connector you use. As a
programmer of ControlMyMonitor, I cannot help you to debug or fix these
hardware problems. You can try to contact the manufacturers of your
hardware and ask them to solve the problem.



Command-Line Options
====================

You can use 'Primary' as your monitor string in all command-line options
in order to specify the primary monitor. You can also use 'Secondary' as
your monitor string in all command-line options in order to specify the
secondary monitor.
If you have multiple monitors, you have to find a string that uniquely
identifies your monitor. Open ControlMyMonitor , select the desired
monitor and then press Ctrl+M (Copy Monitor Settings). Paste the string
from the clipboard into notepad or other text editor. You'll see
something like this:

Monitor Device Name: "\\.\DISPLAY1\Monitor0"
Monitor Name: "22EA53"
Serial Number: "402CFEZE1200"
Adapter Name: "Intel(R) HD Graphics"
Monitor ID: "MONITOR\GSM59A4\{4d36e96e-e325-11ce-bfc1-08002be10318}\0012"
Short Monitor ID: GSM59A4

You can use any string from this list as long as the other monitors on
your system have different values for the same property.



/SetValue <Monitor String> <VCP Code> <Value>
Sets the value of the specified VCP Code for the specified monitor.

Here's some examples:

Set the brightness of primary monitor to 70:
ControlMyMonitor.exe /SetValue Primary 10 70

Set the contrast of the monitor with serial number 102ABC335 to 65:
ControlMyMonitor.exe /SetValue "102ABC335" 12 65

Restore factory defaults to the \\.\DISPLAY1\Monitor0 monitor:
ControlMyMonitor.exe /SetValue "\\.\DISPLAY1\Monitor0" 04 1

Turn on the \\.\DISPLAY2\Monitor0 monitor:
ControlMyMonitor.exe /SetValue "\\.\DISPLAY2\Monitor0" D6 1

Turn off the \\.\DISPLAY2\Monitor0 monitor: (On some monitors you should
set the value to 4 instead of 5)
ControlMyMonitor.exe /SetValue "\\.\DISPLAY2\Monitor0" D6 5

Change the input source of \\.\DISPLAY3\Monitor0 monitor:
ControlMyMonitor.exe /SetValue "\\.\DISPLAY3\Monitor0" 60 3

/SetValueIfNeeded <Monitor String> <VCP Code> <Value>
This command is similar to /SetValue , but it actually sets the value
only if the current value is different from the specified value.

/ChangeValue <Monitor String> <VCP Code> <Value>
Increases/decreases the value of the specified VCP Code for the specified
monitor.

Here's some examples:

Increase the brightness of the secondary monitor by 5%:
ControlMyMonitor.exe /ChangeValue Secondary 10 5

Decrease the contrast of the \\.\DISPLAY1\Monitor0 monitor by 5%:
ControlMyMonitor.exe /ChangeValue "\\.\DISPLAY1\Monitor0" 12 -5

/SwitchValue <Monitor String> <VCP Code> <Value1> <Value2> <Value3>...
Switch between the specified 2 or more values.

For example, this command switches the monitor between off (5) and on (1)
state:
ControlMyMonitor.exe /SwitchValue "\\.\DISPLAY1\Monitor0" D6 1 5

The following command switches between 3 brightness values - 30%, 50%,
90% :
ControlMyMonitor.exe /SwitchValue "\\.\DISPLAY1\Monitor0" 10 30 50 90

/GetValue <Monitor String> <VCP Code>
Return the value of the specified VCP Code for the specified monitor.

Example for batch file:
ControlMyMonitor.exe /GetValue "\\.\DISPLAY1\Monitor0" 10
echo %errorlevel%

/TurnOff <Monitor String>
Turn off the specified monitor.

Example:
ControlMyMonitor.exe /TurnOff "\\.\DISPLAY3\Monitor0"

/TurnOn <Monitor String>
Turn on the specified monitor.

Example:
ControlMyMonitor.exe /TurnOn "\\.\DISPLAY1\Monitor0"

/SwitchOffOn <Monitor String>
Switch the specified monitor between on and off state.

Example:
ControlMyMonitor.exe /SwitchOffOn "\\.\DISPLAY2\Monitor0"

/Wait <Milliseconds>
Wait the specified number of Milliseconds. You can use it to wait before
executing the next command, for example:
ControlMyMonitor.exe /SetValue "\\.\DISPLAY1\Monitor0" D6 1 /Wait 10000
/SetValue "\\.\DISPLAY1\Monitor0" D6 5

/SaveConfig <Filename> <Monitor String>
Saves all read+write values of the specified monitor into a file.
For example:
ControlMyMonitor.exe /SaveConfig "c:\temp\mon1.cfg" Primary
ControlMyMonitor.exe /SaveConfig "c:\temp\mon1.cfg"
"\\.\DISPLAY2\Monitor0"

/LoadConfig <Filename> <Monitor String>
Loads all values stored in configuration file into the specified monitor.
For example:
ControlMyMonitor.exe /LoadConfig "c:\temp\mon1.cfg" Primary
ControlMyMonitor.exe /LoadConfig "c:\temp\mon1.cfg"
"\\.\DISPLAY2\Monitor0"

/stext <Filename> <Monitor String>
Save the current monitor settings into a simple text file.

/stab <Filename> <Monitor String>
Save the current monitor settings into a tab-delimited text file.

/scomma <Filename> <Monitor String>

For all save command-line options, you can specify empty filename in
order to send the data to stdout, for example:
ControlMyMonitor.exe /scomma "" | more



Execute multiple commands at once
=================================

If you want to execute multiple commands, you can do it in a single line,
instead of running ControlMyMonitor.exe multiple times, for example:
ControlMyMonitor.exe /SetValue "\\.\DISPLAY1\Monitor0" 10 70 /SetValue
"\\.\DISPLAY2\Monitor0" 10 80



Get value of the specified VCP Code using GetNir tool
=====================================================

There is also an option to get the current value of the specified VCP
Code with GetNir tool. The value is sent to stdout.
For example, the following command sends the current monitor brightness
to stdout:
ControlMyMonitor.exe /stab "" | GetNir "Current Value" "VCPCode=10"



Translating ControlMyMonitor to other languages
===============================================

In order to translate ControlMyMonitor to other language, follow the
instructions below:
1. Run ControlMyMonitor with /savelangfile parameter:
   ControlMyMonitor.exe /savelangfile
   A file named ControlMyMonitor_lng.ini will be created in the folder of
   ControlMyMonitor utility.
2. Open the created language file in Notepad or in any other text
   editor.
3. Translate all string entries to the desired language. Optionally,
   you can also add your name and/or a link to your Web site.
   (TranslatorName and TranslatorURL values) If you add this information,
   it'll be used in the 'About' window.
4. After you finish the translation, Run ControlMyMonitor, and all
   translated strings will be loaded from the language file.
   If you want to run ControlMyMonitor without the translation, simply
   rename the language file, or move it to another folder.
